//! Locates, builds if necessary, and spawns Verdandi's `apps/claude-sidecar` Node.js process --
//! deliberately NOT reusing `shell/src/supervisor_client.rs`'s spawn pattern wholesale. Two real,
//! verified differences from that pattern (see this plan's "Verified facts", points 5 and 6):
//!
//! 1. `apps/claude-sidecar/dist/` is gitignored in Verdandi, not committed -- a git-dependency
//!    checkout of the Rust protocol crate (Task 1) does NOT give this process a runnable sidecar.
//!    This module locates a real Verdandi checkout on disk and builds the sidecar there if needed.
//! 2. The sidecar treats stdin EOF as its own parent-death shutdown signal (its own `lifecycle.ts`
//!    says so explicitly). `Stdio::null()` -- the pattern `supervisor_client.rs` uses -- makes it
//!    exit within the same tick it starts, since reading from `/dev/null` is an instant EOF. This
//!    module spawns with `Stdio::piped()` for stdin and holds the write handle open for the whole
//!    `SpawnedSidecar`'s lifetime; dropping (or explicitly closing) that handle is the intended
//!    shutdown signal, not a process_group/signal trick.
//!
//! Unlike `supervisor` (a shared, machine-wide, detached daemon `shell` never waits on), each
//! `ClaudeSidecarProvider` owns exactly one sidecar process for its own lifetime, closer to how
//! `agent::process::AgentProcess` owns its one `claude` child -- so this module does NOT detach via
//! `process_group(0)`; the sidecar is meant to die with its owning provider, not outlive it.
